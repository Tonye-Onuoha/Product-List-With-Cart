## My process

The process was very straightforward. I started by writing out the necessary components of the project. I then broke
down the styling of components one piece at a time using CSS with the grid and flexbox layout model, while also
following the mobile-first approach. To complete the layout, I then proceeded to write the media queries for the desktop
design.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 JSX markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox layout model
-   Grid layout model
-   Media queries
