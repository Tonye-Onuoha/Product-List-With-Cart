## 🧩 My Process

The development process was very straightforward:

- I started by breaking the UI down into reusable React components.
- I styled the components incrementally using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- A **mobile-first approach** was followed to ensure responsiveness.
- Finally, I added **media queries** to refine the layout for larger screens.
